This project focuses on anomaly detection in the toy rocket manufacturing process using image data. The primary goal is to identify and classify anomalies in the manufacturing pipeline by analyzing images of the toy rockets. The project uses a combination of image preprocessing, object detection, and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate anomaly detection.
